# Feature Specification: Enhanced Context Loading

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ **Planned**
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Claude
**Created**: 2024-01-XX
**Updated**: 2024-01-XX

## Overview

Enhance the `/prime` command with intelligent context loading that automatically detects project type, loads relevant documentation, understands project structure, and provides better contextual awareness for Claude across different types of projects.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Automatically detect project type (React, Node.js, Python, etc.)
- [ ] Load project-specific documentation and best practices
- [ ] Intelligently parse and understand project structure
- [ ] Load recent git activity for context
- [ ] Detect and load relevant configuration files
- [ ] Show current project status and next steps

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Performance: Context loading should complete in < 5 seconds
- [ ] Scalability: Handle projects with hundreds of files efficiently
- [ ] Maintainability: Easy to add new project types and detection rules

## User Stories

_As a user working with Claude, I want intelligent context loading so that Claude understands my project better_

1. **As a** developer, **I want** Claude to automatically understand my project type **so that** it can provide relevant suggestions and follow appropriate conventions
2. **As a** project maintainer, **I want** Claude to understand recent changes **so that** it can continue work intelligently
3. **As a** team member, **I want** Claude to load project-specific standards **so that** code remains consistent

## Technical Approach

### Architecture

- Enhance existing `/prime` command with intelligent detection
- Create modular project type detectors
- Implement smart file loading based on project context
- Cache project analysis for performance

### Dependencies

- **Internal**: Code standards system (completed), Project management system (completed)
- **External**: None
- **Blockers**: None

### Implementation Plan

1. Create project type detection system
2. Enhance /prime command with intelligent loading
3. Add project-specific documentation templates
4. Implement git activity analysis
5. Create performance optimization for large projects

## Detailed Tasks

_Links to granular task specifications_

- [ ] Create project type detection system â†’ `specs/tasks/enhanced-context-loading/project-type-detection.md`
- [ ] Update /prime command with intelligent loading â†’ `specs/tasks/enhanced-context-loading/prime-enhancement.md`
- [ ] Add git activity analysis â†’ `specs/tasks/enhanced-context-loading/git-analysis.md`
- [ ] Create performance optimizations â†’ `specs/tasks/enhanced-context-loading/performance-optimization.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] /prime command automatically detects common project types (React, Node.js, Python, Next.js, etc.)
- [ ] Relevant project-specific documentation is loaded based on detection
- [ ] Recent git commits and branch information are included in context
- [ ] Project structure is analyzed and key files are identified
- [ ] Configuration files are detected and relevant sections loaded
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable for projects with 100+ files
- [ ] System is extensible for new project types

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Unit tests for project type detection logic
- [ ] Integration tests with sample projects of different types
- [ ] Performance tests with large codebases
- [ ] Manual testing across various project structures

## Rollout Plan

1. **Development**: Create detection system and enhance /prime command (2-3 days)
2. **Testing**: Test with various project types and sizes (1 day)
3. **Deployment**: Update template with enhanced system (immediate)
4. **Monitoring**: Track effectiveness and performance in real projects

## Related Work

- **Depends on**: Code standards system (uses for project-specific loading)
- **Blocks**: Project type detection feature (will be integrated)
- **Related**: Testing integration (will use for test file detection)

## Notes & Decisions

_Key architectural decisions, trade-offs, and reasoning_

- **Decision**: Use file-based detection rather than user input
- **Rationale**: Reduces friction and provides automatic, accurate detection
- **Trade-off**: More complex detection logic vs. simpler user experience

- **Decision**: Implement caching for project analysis
- **Rationale**: Improves performance for repeated /prime command usage
- **Trade-off**: Memory usage vs. performance gains

## Changelog

- **2024-01-XX**: Initial feature specification created

_This specification will be moved to specs/completed/features/ when implementation is complete_
