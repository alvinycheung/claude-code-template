# Feature Specification: Code Standards System

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ **Planned**
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Claude
**Created**: 2024-01-XX
**Updated**: 2024-01-XX

## Overview

Create a comprehensive code standards system that provides Claude with consistent guidelines for writing high-quality, maintainable code across all projects. This system will ensure consistent code style, error handling, security practices, and performance considerations.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Define language-specific coding standards (JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, etc.)
- [ ] Establish consistent naming conventions across all code
- [ ] Create error handling and logging standards
- [ ] Define security best practices for common scenarios
- [ ] Establish performance optimization guidelines

### Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] Performance: Standards must be easy to reference and apply
- [ ] Security: Include security-first coding practices
- [ ] Usability: Clear, actionable guidelines that Claude can follow

## User Stories

_As a user working with Claude, I want consistent code quality so that my projects are maintainable and professional_

1. **As a** developer, **I want** Claude to follow consistent naming conventions **so that** my codebase is readable and maintainable
2. **As a** project owner, **I want** Claude to implement proper error handling **so that** my applications are robust and debuggable
3. **As a** team lead, **I want** Claude to follow security best practices **so that** my applications are secure by default

## Technical Approach

### Architecture

- Create modular documentation in `ai_docs/` directory
- Language-specific standards in separate files for easy loading
- Integration with /prime command for automatic loading based on project type

### Dependencies

- **Internal**: Project management system (already implemented)
- **External**: None
- **Blockers**: None

### Implementation Plan

1. Create main code standards document with universal principles
2. Add language-specific standards for common languages
3. Create code review checklist for Claude to use
4. Update /prime command to load relevant standards
5. Create examples and anti-patterns documentation

## Detailed Tasks

_Links to granular task specifications_

- [ ] Create universal code standards document â†’ `specs/tasks/code-standards-system/universal-standards.md`
- [ ] Create JavaScript/TypeScript standards â†’ `specs/tasks/code-standards-system/javascript-standards.md`
- [ ] Create Python standards â†’ `specs/tasks/code-standards-system/python-standards.md`
- [ ] Create code review checklist â†’ `specs/tasks/code-standards-system/review-checklist.md`
- [ ] Update /prime command integration â†’ `specs/tasks/code-standards-system/prime-integration.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Universal code standards document exists with clear guidelines
- [ ] Language-specific standards cover naming, structure, and patterns
- [ ] Error handling patterns are documented with examples
- [ ] Security best practices are clearly defined
- [ ] Performance guidelines include specific, actionable advice
- [ ] Code review checklist is comprehensive and actionable
- [ ] /prime command loads relevant standards based on project type

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Manual testing: Apply standards to sample projects
- [ ] Validation: Review generated code against standards
- [ ] User feedback: Ensure standards produce better code quality
- [ ] Integration testing: Verify /prime command loads correct standards

## Rollout Plan

1. **Development**: Create all documentation and integration (1-2 days)
2. **Testing**: Apply to test projects and validate effectiveness (1 day)
3. **Deployment**: Update template with complete system (immediate)
4. **Monitoring**: Track code quality improvements in subsequent projects

## Related Work

- **Depends on**: Project management system (completed)
- **Blocks**: Enhanced context loading (will use project type detection)
- **Related**: Testing integration (will reference code standards)

## Notes & Decisions

_Key architectural decisions, trade-offs, and reasoning_

- **Decision**: Use modular approach with language-specific files
- **Rationale**: Allows token-efficient loading of only relevant standards
- **Trade-off**: More files to maintain vs. better performance and relevance

## Changelog

- **2024-01-XX**: Initial feature specification created

_This specification will be moved to specs/completed/features/ when implementation is complete_
