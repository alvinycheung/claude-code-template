# Task Specification: Create Universal Code Standards

**Feature**: Code Standards System â†’ `specs/features/code-standards-system.md`
**Status**: [ ] **Todo**
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: Medium (2-3 hours)
**Assigned**: Claude
**Created**: 2024-01-XX
**Updated**: 2024-01-XX

## Objective

Create a comprehensive universal code standards document that establishes fundamental coding principles and practices that apply across all programming languages and project types.

## Context

This is the foundation document for the code standards system. It will establish core principles that will be referenced by language-specific standards and serve as the primary reference for maintaining code quality consistency.

## Requirements

- [ ] Define universal naming conventions
- [ ] Establish error handling principles
- [ ] Create security-first coding guidelines
- [ ] Define performance optimization principles
- [ ] Establish code organization and structure standards
- [ ] Include documentation requirements

## Implementation Details

### Approach

1. Create `ai_docs/code-standards.md` as the main document
2. Structure content into logical sections (naming, error handling, security, etc.)
3. Include practical examples and anti-patterns
4. Create actionable guidelines that Claude can follow consistently
5. Ensure compatibility with existing project management system

### Technical Specifications

```markdown
# Document structure:

- Universal Principles
- Naming Conventions
- Error Handling & Logging
- Security Best Practices
- Performance Guidelines
- Code Organization
- Documentation Standards
- Examples & Anti-patterns
```

### Files to Modify/Create

- [ ] `ai_docs/code-standards.md` - Main universal standards document
- [ ] Update `ai_docs/project-management.md` - Reference code standards in workflow
- [ ] Update `.claude/commands/prime.md` - Add code standards to loading (future task)

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite Tasks**: None (this is the foundation)
- **External Dependencies**: None
- **Blockers**: None

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Universal code standards document created with all required sections
- [ ] Naming conventions cover variables, functions, classes, files, and directories
- [ ] Error handling principles include logging, user feedback, and debugging
- [ ] Security guidelines cover input validation, authentication, and data protection
- [ ] Performance guidelines include optimization principles and common pitfalls
- [ ] Code organization standards define project structure and modularity
- [ ] Documentation standards specify when and how to document code
- [ ] Examples provided for each major principle
- [ ] Anti-patterns documented to show what to avoid

## Testing

- [ ] Manual review: Ensure all sections are comprehensive and actionable
- [ ] Validation: Apply standards to existing code examples
- [ ] Consistency check: Verify guidelines don't conflict with each other

## Notes

- Focus on principles that apply across languages (avoid language-specific syntax)
- Emphasize maintainability, readability, and security
- Include rationale for each guideline to help Claude understand the "why"
- Keep guidelines specific and actionable rather than vague

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Document created with all required sections
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Document reviewed for clarity and completeness
- [ ] Task marked complete in feature spec
- [ ] Changes committed with proper spec-based message

## Changelog

- **2024-01-XX**: Initial task specification created
