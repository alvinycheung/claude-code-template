## Quick Status Dashboard

- **Active Tasks:** 0

## Current Active Phase

### Phase 1: Project Foundation

- [ ] Complete project template setup
- [ ] Establish project management workflow
- [ ] Set up development environment

## Planning Hierarchy

### Active Detail Plans

> These are the current detailed planning documents that break down the work:

_No active detail plans yet - they will be listed here as they are created_

### Completed Detail Plans

> Moved to `/specs/completed/` - still referenced when relevant:

_No completed detail plans yet_

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate:** Set up project management workflow
2. **Next:** Define specific project goals and create first detail plan
3. **Future:** Begin implementation based on detailed plans

## Notes & Decisions

- Using hierarchical planning: Main plan → Detail plans → Sub-detail plans (up to 3 levels)
- Completed plans move to `/specs/completed/` to keep this view clean
- Detail plans are referenced by filename for easy navigation

**Plan Management:**

- This file is updated whenever high-level status changes
- All task completions should be reflected here and committed with `docs(plan)` scope
- Detail plans are created as `specs/[feature-name]-plan.md`
- Sub-detail plans are created as `specs/[feature-name]-[component]-plan.md`
