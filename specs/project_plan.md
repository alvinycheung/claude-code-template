## Recent Completed Work

_Major milestones and completed features will be listed here_

- âœ… **2024-01-XX**: Initial AI project management system implementation
- âœ… **2024-01-XX**: Spec-based commit message convention established

## Archived Features

_Links to completed features moved to specs/completed/_

[See specs/completed/archive-index.md for full archive]

## Notes & Decisions

_Important architectural decisions, trade-offs, and project notes_

- **Project Management**: Using hierarchical specs system for token efficiency
- **Git Workflow**: Manual commits with conventional commit messages using spec-based prefixes
- **AI Integration**: Claude manages specs and tracks progress
- **Enhancement Strategy**: Focus on high-impact improvements first (code standards, context loading)
