# Feature: Hierarchical Project Management System

## Overview

Implementation of a multi-level project management system that helps Claude track requests efficiently while optimizing token usage through hierarchical organization and automatic archiving.

## Requirements

- [ ] Multi-level specification structure (3 levels)
- [ ] Automatic archiving of completed specs
- [ ] Token-efficient /prime command integration
- [ ] Cross-reference management between specs
- [ ] Session-based request tracking

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] Design hierarchical file structure
- [x] Create project management documentation
- [x] Design spec file templates
- [ ] Update /prime command to read specs directory
- [ ] Create example component and task specs
- [ ] Test archiving workflow

## Dependencies

- Depends on: Repository setup, Git integration
- Blocks: Advanced template features, complex project workflows

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] /prime command reads all active specs efficiently
- [ ] Completed specs can be archived automatically
- [ ] Cross-references update when specs are moved
- [ ] Token usage for /prime is optimized
- [ ] Request tracking works seamlessly during sessions

## Status

- **Created:** 2024-12-19
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Assigned to:** Claude

## Notes

- System designed for 3-level hierarchy: project_plan.md (L1) → feature-_.md (L2) → component/task-_.md (L3)
- Completed specs moved to specs/completed/ with timestamp prefix
- Each spec file should stay under 1000 tokens when possible
- Cross-references use relative paths for maintainability

## Related Specs

- Main project plan: [project_plan.md](./project_plan.md)
- Implementation tasks may spawn component-specific specs as needed
