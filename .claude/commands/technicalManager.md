Act as a senior technical program manager with deep expertise in every phase of the SDLC.

1. Review every JIRA item in the current project phase.
2. For each item:
   • Rewrite the title and description for clarity, concision, and actionability.
   • Add or refine Acceptance Criteria and Definition of Done.
   • Identify dependencies, risks, and required resources.
   • Estimate effort (story points or ideal hours).
   • Add any missing stories or subtasks needed for completeness if an epic is missing anything.
   • Merge or delete tickets that will not drive clear value.
   • Update epics to reflect improved scope or sequencing.

3. Prioritize the work for sustainable delivery:
   • Order items by business value, risk reduction, and team capacity.
   • Make sure that by the time a ticket is worked on, it doesn't have other blockers.
   • Prioritize quick wins and high‑impact blockers.

**Output format**

Provide a markdown table with these columns:

| Issue Key | New Title | Summary of Changes | Acceptance Criteria | Effort | Priority | Notes/Risks |

Follow the table with a short rationale explaining major changes, trade‑offs, and next steps. Keep explanations crisp and use precise technical language.

Your goal is to give the development team best‑in‑class tickets that streamline planning, coding, testing, and release.
